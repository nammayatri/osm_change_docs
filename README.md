2. Draw **sidewalks** near the track and **connect them to outside roads**.  
<br>
3. Mark them as `footway` (type = *foot*).  
<br>

* Always double-check connectivity (sidewalks and crossings).
* Keep commits focused (one station fix per commit).
* If in doubt, document the change in commit message.
